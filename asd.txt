how to take integers from 
4.1	 billAmount=(float) (30+((minutes-30)*0.5));
	this.billNo = (int)Math.round(Math.random()*10);
	c[0].calculateBill(minutes);   CAN DO
int customerId= (int)Math.round(Math.random()*10);
5.1	IMP 	emp[0]=new Technical(empId, empName, dateofjoin, basicSal);
6.1 treemap<> .put  Order order, calling order by passing only 2 parameters
you do it personally

6.2 FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(args[0]);

		ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(fis);

******************** emp =   (Employee) ois.readObject();***********
(type cat it) while reading      
	 System.out.println(emp.getDeptNo());
============================

============

		FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream("employee.txt ");
